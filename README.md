LICENSE: GPL 3.0. Commerical use of MySQL requires a GPL license, so we chose that over MIT License. 

To use, execute the `exchange.sql` file against a MySQL or MariaDB database. 

This is currently a SQL-only with no frontend. A frontend can be added if necessary. 

The exchange is intended to be generic enough to support any type of coin or pairs. The only coin-specific code here is the deposit or withdraw script for each coin. These don't exist yet for Grin. They are a work in progress.
